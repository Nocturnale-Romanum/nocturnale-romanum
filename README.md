# nocturnale-romanum
Main repository for the Nocturnale Romanum

The Nocturnale Romanum is the chant book of the churches of Roman Rite for chanting Matins, the night hour of Divine Office.

The Nocturnale Romanum has more than 1400 pieces that need to be restituted, transcribed and typeset.

Our project builds upon the great work of Holger Peter Sandhofe, who published the first complete Nocturnale Romanum in 2002.

It aims to provide better restitutions of ancient pieces and other options for newly-composed pieces, as well as a replacement for print copies, given that the 2002 NR is no longer available in print.

# development plan
Development will start with the constitution of a committee of experts who will made top-level editorial choices for the Nocturnale.

In parallell, an assessment of the work at hand will be made, with an inventory of all the pieces to be included in the book, and an inventory of the state of the art in terms of restitutions of Matins antiphons and responsories.
