# nocturnale-romanum
Main repository for the Nocturnale Romanum

The Nocturnale Romanum is the chant book of the churches of Roman Rite for chanting Matins, the night hour of Divine Office.

The Nocturnale Romanum has more than 1400 pieces that need to be restituted, transcribed and typeset.

Our project builds upon the great work of Holger Peter Sandhofe, who published the first complete Nocturnale Romanum in 2002.

It aims to provide better restitutions of ancient pieces and other options for newly-composed pieces, as well as a replacement for print copies, given that the 2002 NR is no longer available in print.

# top-level development plan
- Setting up a steering committee: mostly done: Fr. Damien (Le Barroux) (liturgical chant), D. Crochu (musicology), G. Gapsys (musicology), F. Ramel (typography). Having a secular priest that sings Matins at least weekly would be nice.
- Inventory of pieces and feasts to be included: done.
- Setting up a website for anyone to submit resitution proposals: ongoing.
- Draft one: "all of the material, none of the corrections". Sandhofe melodies, but the structure, the rubrics, the layout. Basically a starting point for people to start making corrections. PDF only. Ongoing.
- Rubrical audit of draft one: not yet started
- Typographical audit of draft one: not yet started
- Inclusion of Gregofacsimil restitution: not yet started
- Inclusion of parodies for chants that do not have music yet / those composed by HPS: not yet started
- Draft two: "something vaguely usable". Gregofacsimil melodies from Hartker, some new chants, a nice typesetting, but still a lot of work. PDF and Paperback because this is a temporary book.
- Two years of all kinds of corrections
- Release of version 1
